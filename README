This is project is to run a Raspberry PI as an audio device. The 
device is able to do 2 functions: as a sound collector and as a 
test-tone generator.

1. Configuaration Instruction

We implement this project with a Raspberry PI, a USB sound card, a network connection and a 
microphone.

1.1 Set audio sound card as a default audio device.

	1.1.1. Aborting RPi, apply the USB sound card.
	1.1.2. Use “lsusb” adminitratively display USB buses info in case of the USB sound card 
		is broken-in.
	1.1.3. Use “sudo nano /etc/asound.conf”command and put following content to the file:
		"pcm.!default {
		  type plug
		  slave {
		    pcm "hw:1,0"
		  }
		}
		ctl.!default {
			type hw
			card 1
		} "
	1.1.4. At your home directory, Use “nano .asoundrc” command and give the above 
		similar content.
	1.1.5.Run alsamixer, USB sound card must display as a default audio device 
		when the successful installation. 

1.2 Install libcurl library 
	
	1.2.1. Check if your libcurl library is installed or not.
	1.2.2. If libcurl library is not yet installed in your PI
	       Run “sudo apt-get update” to update the application list.
	1.2.3. Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl3” to install the libcurl3.
	1.2.4. Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev” to install the development
	       API of libcurl4.

2. Installation Instrucstions

	2.1 In your installation directory, use command "make" to create 
	    executable file.
	2.2. If the program is sucessful installed, you should be able to see "sound.out" file.

3. Operating Instructions
	
3.1 Realtime sound collector function.
	3.1.1. In your installation directory,run the program by using command "./sound.out".	 
	3.1.2. The program runs as infinite loop that record the sound and show on the graph.
	3.1.3. To terminate the program, press "Ctrl" + "C".

3.2 Testtone generator function.
	3.2.1. Using command "./sound.out 440" or "./sound.out 1000" to genenrate a testtone.
	3.2.2. Choose the channel of the testtone.
	3.2.3. Choose the duration of the testtone.
	3.2.4. If testtone were succesfully generated, you should able to see "testTone.wav".
